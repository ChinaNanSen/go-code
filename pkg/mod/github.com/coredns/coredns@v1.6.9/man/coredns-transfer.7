\fBZONES\fP The zones \fItransfer\fP will answer zone requests for. If left blank,
the zones are inherited from the enclosing server block. To answer zone
transfers for a given zone, there must be another plugin in the same server
block that serves the same zone, and implements \fB\fCtransfer.Transferer\fR.

\fB\fCto\fR \fBHOST...\fP The hosts \fItransfer\fP will transfer to. Use \fB\fC*\fR to permit
transfers to all hosts.
